"""Browse ALL discovered glyph families in one animated curses viewer.

Left pane: every family (spinners, ramps, fill-pairs, cycles) in one scrollable
list. Right pane: the selected family ANIMATING in place, so a spinner spins, a
ramp ramps and a fill pulses while you browse. Reads the catalog written by
``glyph_audit.py families --json`` for instant startup; if it is missing the
families are computed on launch (slower).

Run:
    python3 scripts/glyph_audit.py families --json   # build catalog once
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --saved  # replay your reviewed families
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --foliage-strokes
        # review real stroked glyph sets for tree outer/mid/interior roles
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --mode cycle  # browse every discovered cycle
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --block Arrows
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --mode distract
        # every glyph ranked by DISTRACTION weight, alphanumerics flagged
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --mode combo
        # useful-combination review: authored seeds, mined usage, measured Unicode runs
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --mode authored
        # the nine authored seed combinations, each beside its mirror
    python3 scripts/glyph_families_viewer.py --mode dir8 --dump
        # text dump of the groups; no TTY needed (headless verification)

Axes (top legend, switch with m):
    ALL  ROTATE(spin)  DIR8  DENSITY(ramp)  FILL  CYCLE  MIRROR  STRUCT(topo)
    FOLIAGE STROKES  DISTRACT  COMBOS  AUTHORED
Rotation is its own axis; CYCLE holds animation cycles of every length (3..16),
filterable by length so each band is browsable on its own. With no --mode, ALL
loads discovered families plus the local review surfaces: foliage stroke sets,
authored combinations, mined usage, measured seam candidates, and discovered
runs. DISTRACT is intentionally explicit because it is a one-glyph ranking over
the whole corpus, not a family list.

Controls:
    up/down or j/k   select family
    PgUp/PgDn        page
    m                next axis (ALL / ROTATE / DENSITY / FILL / CYCLE / STRUCT)
    1-9              show only families of that length (e.g. 4 = 4-frame cycles)
    0                clear the length filter (all lengths)
    space            pause / resume animation
    + / -            faster / slower
    This standalone viewer is read-only; source-repository family saving and
    runtime handoff stay in the Asciicker workspace.
